*.s7z
# Old archive versions only 	Proprietary format
*.ace
# A format that compresses and doubly encrypt the data (AES256 and CAS256) avoiding brute force attacks, also hide files in an AFA file. It has two ways to safeguard data integrity and subsequent repair of the file if has an error (repair with AstroA2P (online) or Astrotite (offline)).
*.afa
# A mainly Korean format designed for very large archives.
*.alz
# Android application package (variant of JAR file format).
*.apk

*.car 
# Open source file format.
*.cfs
# Compact Pro archive, a common archiver used on Mac platforms until about Mac OS 7.5.x. Competed with StuffIt; now obsolete.
*.cpt 
# Windows, Unix-like, Mac OS X Open source file format. Files are compressed individually with either gzip, bzip2 or lzo.
*.dar
# DiskDoubler 	Mac OS 			obsolete
*.dd
# ??
*.dgc
# Apple Disk Image upports "Internet-enabled" disk images, which, once downloaded, are automatically decompressed, mounted, have the contents extracted, and thrown away. Currently, Safari is the only browser that supports this form of extraction; however, the images can be manually extracted as well. This format can also be password-protected or encrypted with 128-bit or 256-bit AES encryption.
*.dmg
# Enterprise Java Archive archive
*.ear
# ETSoft compressed archive

*.pim 
# PackIt 	Mac OS 			obsolete
*.pit
# Used for data in games written using the Quadruple D library for Delphi. Uses byte pair compression.
*.qda 
# A proprietary archive format, second in popularity to .zip files.
# The format from a commercial archiving package. Odd among commercial packages in that they focus on incorporating experimental algorithms with the highest possible compression (at the expense of speed and memory), such as PAQ, PPMD and PPMZ (PPMD with unlimited-length strings), as well as a proprietary algorithms.
*.rk 
# Self Dissolving ARChive 	Commodore 64, Commodore 128 	Commodore 64, Commodore 128 	Yes 	SDAs refer to Self Dissolving ARC files, and are based on the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 versions of ARC, originally written by Chris Smeets. While the files share the same extension, they are not compatible between platforms. That is, an SDA created on a Commodore 64 but run on a Commodore 128 in Commodore 128 mode will crash the machine, and vice versa. The intended successor to SDA is SFX.
*.sda
# A pre-Mac OS X Self-Extracting Archive format. StuffIt, Compact Pro, Disk Doubler and others could create .sea files, though the StuffIt versions were the most common.
*.sea 
# Scifer Archive with internal header
*.sen 
# Commodore 64, Commodore 128 	SFX is a Self Extracting Archive which uses the LHArc compression algorithm. It was originally developed by Chris Smeets on the Commodore platform, and runs primarily using the CS-DOS extension for the Commodore 128. Unlike its predecessor SDA, SFX files will run on both the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 regardless of which machine they were created on.
*.sfx 
# An archive format designed for the Apple II series of computers. The canonical implementation is ShrinkIt, which can operate on disk images as well as files. Preferred compression algorithm is a combination of RLE and 12-bit LZW. Archives can be manipulated with the command-line NuLib tool, or the Windows-based CiderPress.
*.shk 
# A compression format common on Apple Macintosh computers. The free StuffIt Expander is available for Windows and OS X.
# The replacement for the .sit format that supports more compression methods, UNIX file permissions, long file names, very large files, more encryption options, data specific compressors (JPEG, Zip, PDF, 24-bit image, MP3). The free StuffIt Expander is available for Windows and OS X.
# A royalty-free compressing format
*.sqx 
# The "tarball" format combines tar archives with a file-based compression scheme (usually gzip). Commonly used for source and binary distribution on Unix-like platforms, widely available elsewhere.
*.tar.gz
*.tgz
*.tar.Z
*.tar.bz2
*.tbz2
*.tar.lzma
*.tlz
# UltraCompressor 2.3 was developed to act as an alternative to the then popular PKZIP application. The main feature of the application is its ability to create large archives. This means that compressed archives with the UC2 file extension can hold almost 1 million files.
*.uc
*.uc0
*.uc2
*.ucn
*.ur2
*.ue2
# Based on PAQ, RZM, CSC, CCM, and 7zip. The format consists of a PAQ, RZM, CSC, or CCM compressed file and a manifest with compression settings stored in a 7z archive.

*.xp3 
# Yamazaki zipper archive. Compression format used in DeepFreezer archiver utility created by Yamazaki Satoshi. Read and write support exists in TUGZip, IZArc and ZipZag
*.yz1 
# The most widely used compression format on Microsoft Windows. Commonly used on Macintosh and Unix systems as well.
# application/x-zoo 	zoo 	Multiple 	Multiple 	Yes 	
*.zoo
# Journaling (append-only) archive format with rollback capability. Supports deduplication and incremental update based on last-modified dates. Multi-threaded. Compresses in LZ77, BWT, and context mixing formats. Open source.
*.zpaq 
# Archiver with a compression algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform method.
*.zz 


### Compression ###

### From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats

## Compression only
# An open source, patent- and royalty-free compression format. The compression algorithm is a Burrows-Wheeler transform followed by a move-to-front transform and finally Huffman coding
*.bz2
# Old compressor for QNX4 OS. The compression algorithm is a modified LZSS, with an adaptive Huffman coding.
*.F 
# GNU Zip, the primary compression format used by Unix-like systems. The compression algorithm is DEFLATE.
# An alternate LZMA algorithm implementation, with support for checksums and ident bytes.
*.lz
# The LZMA compression algorithm as used by 7-Zip
*.lzma
# An implementation of the LZO data compression algorithm
*.lzo
# A compression program designed to do particularly well on very large files containing long distance redundancy.
*.rz 
# Windows compress/decompress- Linux and Mac OS X decompress only 	A compression program designed to do high compression on SF2 files (SoundFont)
*.sfark 
# A compression format invented by Google and open-sourced in 2011. Snappy aims for very high speeds, reasonable compression, and maximum stability rather than maximum compression or compatibility with any other compression library.
*.sz
# Squeeze: A program which compressed files. A file which was "squeezed" had the middle initial of the name changed to "Q", so that a squeezed text file would end with .TQT, a squeezed executable would end with .CQM or .EQE. Typically used with .LBR archives, either by storing the squeezed files in the archive, or by storing the files decompressed and then compressing the archive, which would have a name ending in ".LQR".
*.?Q?
# A compression program written by Steven Greenberg implementing the LZW algorithm. For several years in the CP/M world when no implementation was available of ARC, CRUNCHed files stored in .LBR archives were very popular. CRUNCH's implementation of LZW had a somewhat unique feature of modifying and occasionally clearing the code table in memory when it became full, resulting in a few percent better compression on many files.
*.?Z?
# A compression format using LZMA2 to yield very high compression ratios.
*.xz
# The traditional Huffman coding compression format.
*.z
# The traditional LZW compression format.
*.Z
# Joke compression program, actually increasing file size
*.infl 
# Compression format(s) used by some DOS and Windows install programs. MS-DOS includes expand.exe to decompress its install files. The compressed files are created with a matching compress.exe command. The compression algorithm is LZSS.
*.??_
